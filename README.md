###To run the application

This application leverages Spring profiles.


In the default and cloud profiles the application is set to use an embedded H2 database.
To take advantage of Pivotal CF's auto-configuration for services.  No
additional configuration is necessary when running locally or in Pivotal CF.

To leverage a user provided MySQL Service do the following:
    
 * set environment varaible to activate the mysql-ups profile

spring_profiles_active = mysql-ups

 * create and bind a user provided service pointing to a mysql database named cfw-ups-mysql
